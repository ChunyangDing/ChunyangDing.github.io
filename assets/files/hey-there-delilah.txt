Hey There Delilah 
by the Plain White Ts

D							  F#m
Hey there, Delilah, What's it like in New York city?
      D								 	 F#m
I'm a thousand miles away, but, girl, tonight you look so pretty
		 Bm  G				   A				  Bm				 A
Yes, you do, Time Square can't shine as bright as you, I swear it's true

Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen
Close your eyes, listen to my voice, it's my disguise, I'm by your side

D					    Bm (A) 
Oh, it's what you do to me x4
What you do to me (D)

D F#m D F#m | Bm G A Bm A

Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would, my word is good

Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you, would take your breath away
I'd write it all, even more in love with me you'd fall, we'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me x4

G									   A
A thousand miles seems pretty far, but they've got planes and trains and cars
D								  Bm
I'd walk to you if I had no other way

G A | D Bm

Our friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way

G A | Bm A

Delilah, I can promise you, that by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same, and you're to blame

D F#m D F#m | Bm G A Bm A

Hey there, Delilah, you be good, and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be makin' history
like I do, you'll know it's all because of you
G			  A			   Bm
We can do whatever we want to
G		   A				  Bm				 A
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you, this ones for you

D Bm | D Bm (A) 
Oh, it's what you do to me x4
What you do to me
